## 🔧 Latest Refactoring: WebSocket Removal & Stability Improvements (2024)

### Problem Identification
The application was experiencing duplicate task creation issues caused by:
- **WebSocket Event Conflicts**: Multiple WebSocket events triggering duplicate API calls
- **React.StrictMode Effects**: Development mode causing double-invocation of effects
- **Race Conditions**: Simultaneous WebSocket and HTTP API calls creating data inconsistencies

### Solution Implemented

#### 1. Complete WebSocket Removal
**Backend Changes:**
- Removed `TasksGateway` from `tasks.module.ts`
- Deleted `tasks.gateway.ts` file
- Removed WebSocket event constants and types
- Eliminated `EventEmitterModule` integration
- Removed WebSocket-related dependencies from `package.json`

**Frontend Changes:**
- Deleted `websocketService.ts` entirely
- Removed WebSocket imports from `taskStore.ts`
- Eliminated WebSocket event handlers and state
- Removed `socket.io-client` dependency
- Simplified task creation/update logic to pure REST API calls

#### 2. React.StrictMode Resolution
**Issue:** React.StrictMode in development mode was causing duplicate function invocations
**Solution:** Removed `React.StrictMode` wrapper from `index.tsx`

```typescript
// Before (causing duplicates)
root.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>
);

// After (fixed)
root.render(
  <App />
);
```
